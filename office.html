        <h2>Microsoft Word</h2>
        <p>
          Microsoft Word is a word processor developed by Microsoft. It was
          first released on October 25, 1983 under the name Multi-Tool Word
          for Xenix systems. Subsequent versions were later written for
          several other platforms including IBM PCs running DOS (1983), Apple
          Macintosh running the Classic Mac OS (1985), AT&T Unix PC (1985),
          Atari ST (1988), OS/2 (1989), Microsoft Windows (1989), SCO Unix
          (1994), and macOS (formerly OS X; 2001). Commercial versions of
          Word are licensed as a standalone product or as a component of
          Microsoft Office, Windows RT or the discontinued Microsoft Works
          suite. Microsoft Word Viewer and Office Online are freewared
          editions of Word with limited features.

        <h2>Microsoft Excel</h2>
        <p>
          Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet developed by Microsoft for Windows,
          macOS, Android and iOS. It features calculation, graphing tools,
          pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic
          for Applications (VBA). It has been a very widely applied
          spreadsheet for these platforms, especially since version 5 in 1993,
          and it has replaced Lotus 1-2-3 as the industry standard for
          spreadsheets. Excel forms part of the Microsoft Office suite of
          software.

        <h2>Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
        <p>
          Microsoft PowerPoint is a presentation program, created by Robert
          Gaskins and Dennis Austin at a software company named Forethought,
          Inc. It was released on April 20, 1987, initially for Macintosh
          System Operating system based computers only. Microsoft acquired
          PowerPoint for $14 million three months after it appeared. This was
          Microsoft's first significant acquisition, and Microsoft set up a
          new business unit for PowerPoint in Silicon Valley where Forethought
          had been located. Microsoft PowerPoint is one of many programs run
          by the company Microsoft and can be identified by its trademark
          orange, and P initial on the logo. It offers users many ways to
          display information from simple presentations to complex multimedia
          presentations.

        <h2>Microsoft Outlook</h2>
        <p>
          Microsoft Outlook is a personal information manager software system
          from Microsoft, available as a part of the Microsoft Office suite.
          Though primarily an email client, Outlook also includes such
          functions as calendaring, task managing, contact managing, note-
          taking, journal logging, and web browsing. It can be used as a
          stand-alone application, or can work with Microsoft Exchange Server
          and Microsoft SharePoint Server for multiple users in an
          organization, such as shared mailboxes and calendars, Exchange
          public folders, SharePoint lists, and meeting schedules. Microsoft
          has also released mobile applications for most mobile platforms,
          including iOS and Android. Developers can also create their own
          custom software that works with Outlook and Office components using
          Microsoft Visual Studio. In addition, mobile devices can synchronize
          almost all Outlook data to Outlook Mobile.
